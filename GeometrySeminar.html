<br> Unless otherwise stated, Geometry Seminars are on Wednesdays at 3pm, Geometry and Analysis Seminars are on Wednesdays at 4:30pm. These take place on Zoom or in person, usually in Roger Stevens LT 11. When on Zoom we will still meet (when possible) to view the zoom seminar. The joint geometry and analysis seminars are also listed <a href="http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtbgs/current_seminar.html">here</a> and are co-organised with <a href="http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtbgs/">Ben Sharp</a>.

<i>Deformations of G_2-instantons on nearly G_2 manifolds</i><br>
<font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">
<b>Abstract.</b>
 In this talk we will study the deformation theory of G_2-instantons on nearly G_2 manifolds. There is a one-to-one correspondence between nearly parallel G_2 structures and real Killing spinors, thus the deformation theory can be formulated in terms of spinors and Dirac operators. We prove that the space of infinitesimal deformations of an instanton is isomorphic to the kernel of an elliptic operator. Using this formulation we prove that abelian instantons are rigid. Then we apply our results to describe the deformation space of the canonical connection on the four normal homogeneous nearly G_2 manifolds. We also see that the deformation spaces obtained are integrable in most of the cases.

<i>A Gluing Construction for Calorons</i><br>
<font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">
<b>Abstract.</b>
Calorons are instantons on $\mathbb{R}^{3}\times S^{1}$, e.g. anti-self-dual connections which are periodic in one direction. Certain explicit caloron configurations have an interpretation as a ``superposition'' of monopoles. I will present a gluing construction which formalises this constituent monopole picture. This construction starts from a singular background and glues in ``fundamental calorons'' to desingularise the configuration. I will introduce what these constituents are, sketch the basics of the construction, and outline some applications to understanding caloron moduli spaces. This is joint work with Lorenzo Foscolo.

<i>Uniqueness of ancient solutions to curvature flows</i><br>
<font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">
<b>Abstract.</b>
Ancient solutions of the mean curvature flow and Ricci flow arise naturally as blowup limits at singularities. In recent years there has been a lot of progress towards the classification of such solutions. We will discuss some uniqueness results for convex ancient solutions of mean curvature flow, and ancient solutions of Ricci flow which have nonnegative curvature operator. In both cases we show that, under an optimal curvature growth assumption (Type I growth), the solution evolves self-similarly by scaling. The arguments for the two flows are surprisingly similar, despite being completely extrinsic and intrinsic, respectively.

<i>Closed Ricci Flows with Singularities Modeled on Asymptotically Conical Shrinkers</i><br>
<font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">
<b>Abstract.</b>
Shrinking Ricci solitons are Ricci flow solutions that self-similarly shrink under the flow. Their significance comes from the fact that finite-time Ricci flow singularities are typically modeled on gradient shrinking Ricci solitons. Here, we shall address a certain converse question, namely, “Given a complete, noncompact gradient shrinking Ricci soliton, does there exist a Ricci flow on a closed manifold that forms a finite-time singularity modeled on the given soliton?” We’ll discuss work that shows the answer is yes when the soliton is asymptotically conical. No symmetry or Kahler assumption is required, and so the proof involves an analysis of the Ricci flow as a nonlinear degenerate parabolic PDE system in its full complexity. We’ll also discuss applications to the (non-)uniqueness of weak Ricci flows through singularities.

<br>Jason Cantarella (University of Georgia) <br> 
<i>"Topological" polymers and random graph embeddings or "Can you hear the structure of a polymer network?"</i><br>
<font size="-1" face="Arial,Helvetica">
<b>Abstract.</b>
Biological structures such as collagen are often composed of complex networks of polymers. The chemistry and physics of these substances are a function of the random shapes that these networks assume in solution as they are perturbed by thermal motions. In this talk, we'll discuss the surprisingly deep and interesting geometry and topology involved in predicting the statistical properties of the shape ensemble from the graph structure and the type of bonds in the model. We will first give a generalization of the Gaussian theory of elastic networks, seeing how the spectrum of the combinatorial and Riemannian Laplace operators allow us to predict the average size of molecules in solution. We validate the model with experimental data from recently synthesized network polymers from the Tezuka lab at Tokyo Tech. We'll then switch to the freely-jointed network model, where the distances between monomers are fixed. In this model, the conformal geometry of the Poincare disk will be used to develop new algorithms for ring polymer ensemble sampling. The theme of the talk is that there are many more applications for differential geometry and algebraic topology in physics and biology than one might expect. We'll include some open questions. 

The talk will cover joint work with Clayton Shonkwiler (Colorado State), Tetsuo Deguchi and Erica Uehara (Ochanomizu University), and Henrik Schumacher (Chemnitz).
