Below are various pictures of geometric shapes which were mentioned in the course (some are just links to external sites).

<a name="CurveShortening"><h1> Curve Shortening Flow </h1></a>

We saw that curve shortening flow was given by a time dependant curve <img src="gamma.jpg" border="0" width = 140/> such that
<center><img src="equation.jpg" border="0" width = 150/></center>

We may calculate explicitly the evolution of a circle:
<a href="circle1.html"> The Circle </a><br><br>

The first results on the curve shortening flow demonstrated that convex curves shrink to points, as in <a href="convex2.html"> this </a> example.<br><br> 

Then, Gage and Hamilton observed that if we rescale (both in time and space) so that the area inside the curve remains constant then any convex curve converges to a circle as we may see <a href="usualconvex2.html"> here </a>.<br><br>

Finally Grayson's theorem shows that any curve becomes convex before it becomes singular, yeilding fantastic "uncoiling" phenomena as we may see <a href="usualspiral2.html"> here </a> (apologies, I programmed this pretty quickly, there are some numerical errors which mean the final circle accellerates off to the bottom right, but you get the idea...).


<a name="MinimalSurfaces"><h1> Minimal Surfaces </h1></a>

We recall that a minimal surface is one with H=0, or equivalently it is a stationary point of the area (which we may hope is a minimiser of area, hence the name). We explicitly calculated curvatures of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenoid"> the catenoid </a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicoid"> the helicoid </a>. 

I briefly mentioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarz_minimal_surface">
the Schwarz p-surface </a> and also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa%27s_minimal_surface"> Costa's surface</a>

However this is nothing. You should all definitely check out the
<center><a href="http://virtualmathmuseum.org/Surface/gallery_m.html"><h2>Minimal surfaces at the Virtual Mathematics Museum</h2></a> </center> these pictures are amazing. Check out the gyroid, the double Eneper surface, Riemann's surface...hours of clicking...Also I strongly recommend clicking on individual surfaces and scrolling on interactive pictures, looking at the 3d versions with 3d glasses etc.
